      <h2>About me:</h2>
      <article>
        <p>Hello world! I am an aspiring web developer/code wizard. I have been learning javascript, python, html, and css independently for about a year. Before becoming interested in programming I taught high school English for five years at a Title One school. It was a challenging job, but it taught me a lot of persistence, organization, and management skills that can apply to any field. I also found the most enjoyable part of the job to be designing my classroom websites and trying to make them as functional and easy to use as possible for my students.</p>
        <p>Outside of learning programming I have a few hobbies. I enjoy cooking (the more complicated the recipe the better as long as I don’t have to do dishes). I enjoy strength training and trying to set new PRs in the gym. My current goal is to get to a 300 lb deadlift by the end of the year. I love long fantasy novels and TV series that are inscrutable unless you read the wiki. Finally I enjoy difficult and confusing video games like the Dark Souls series. One of the ways I knew that programming was for me was when I felt a rush solving a freecodecamp algorithm that was similar to beating a nearly impossible 'Souls' boss.</p>
        <p>I am very excited to begin my Digital Crafts journey. I cannot wait to meet my classmates and see the things that we will build. I know that it won’t be easy, but if it were, I probably wouldn’t be doing it.</p>
